                <h2>Memento is a digital exhibition, a synergy of western and eastern culture that do not reject, instead, embrace this reality of hybridity through our disppearing monuments. Singapore no longer fits the old orientalist image of colonial “asia”. It is a non-western other which does not know its place: in becoming modern, it has lost its innocuous exotic charms, while it will simultaneously never match up to the standards of western modernity. This reality of hybridity with its related dynamics of cultural impurity, mixture, and fusion, presents a problem in the dominant global cultural order, where nation-states are supposed to have pure and unified, if not homogeneous national cultures. Memento reinterprets the very first purified and unified western typeface, Capitalis Monumentalis, into Singapore’s diversified, multicultural monuments. Bridging the old founded relics and typography of Rome into the new, technological world of Singapore, culture has always occupied a special place of importance in the politics of national homogenisation in Singapore’s nation-state. </h2>
